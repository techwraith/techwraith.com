**_Hi. I'm Dan. I build [systems](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1603580557/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1603580557&linkCode=as2&tag=techwraith-20&linkId=308b02a7b2eeb400cb215416315eac2e) that help teams make great decisions_**

Everything is a system. Your team, your company, your product, and even your life. And when you know how to reason about systems, it becomes possible to make better decisions to drive the outcomes that you want to achieve. Without understanding how a particular system works, you'll be flying blind.

### Helping teams build systems for over a decade.

I've been fortunate to work with some amazing teams and companies. I was an early engineer at [Yammer](https://yammer.com), CTO at [Getable](https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/25/getable-5m/), and VP of Engineering at [Eaze](https://eaze.com). I'm now the founder and CEO of [Viable](https://askviable.com). 

I've learned a lot along the way about what it takes to build great products and teams. I've also learned that it's not always easy. In fact, it's hard. Really hard.

But that's okay. Because the hard things are usually the most worthwhile. 

My goal is to help you build something great. Whether it's a product, a team, or a company, I want to share what I've learned so you can create something amazing. 

So let's get started.
