**_Greetings, Curious Mind,_**

I'm Dan Erickson, Founder and CEO of Viable. My career journey has meandered through various roles, including VP of Engineering at Eaze, CTO at Getable, and as an early engineer at Yammer. Currently, my focus is on transforming customer feedback from raw data into a strategic asset for companies.

**_While job titles offer a snapshot, they often fail to capture the complexity of one's approach._** I use systems thinking to map out complex landscapes and identify leverage points for change. **_In parallel, narrative helps me understand human motivations, enabling me to apply that understanding to effect meaningful shifts within those systems._** The blend of these two perspectives is my compass for navigating both the technological and organizational facets of my work.

If you're as fascinated by the intricacies of technology, systems, and what makes people tick as I am, I'd love for you to jump in. **_You're welcome to read what I've written, share your thoughts, or even team up with me on a project._** Together, we can make a real impact.

Best regards,
Dan Erickson
