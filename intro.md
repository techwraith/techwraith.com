Systems thinking is the foundation of critical thinking. Whether you want to create change in your personal life, build a better product, or run a meaningful company, becoming a systems thinker will help you learn and make better decisions.

**_I've been fortunate to work with some amazing teams and products_**. <br/>I was an early engineer at [Yammer](https://yammer.com), CTO at [Getable](https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/25/getable-5m/), and VP of Engineering at [Eaze](https://eaze.com). I'm now the founder and CEO of [Viable](https://askviable.com). 

**_I’ve learned a lot along the way about what it takes to build great products and teams_**, and what I've learned is that it’s not always easy. In fact, it's damn hard. Really damn hard.

But that’s okay. Because the hard things in life are usually the most worthwhile.

**_My goal is to help you build something great_**. Whether it’s a product, a team, or a company, I want to share what I’ve learned so you can create something amazing.

**_**So let’s get started.**_**
